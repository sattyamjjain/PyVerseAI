If it is, it logs a message and returns early, preventing a new update from starting. This effectively queues the user's actions, ensuring that updates to the item count are sequential.\n","\n","- **Resetting the Flag**: The flag is reset in the **`finally`** block of the promise chain, ensuring it's always reset regardless of whether the promise was resolved or rejected.
